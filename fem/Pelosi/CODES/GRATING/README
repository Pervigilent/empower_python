  Directory Contents:

 +-- GRATING.FOR   - The main program
 +-- G_SUBS.FOR    - Subroutines
 |
 +-- CPLANE -+-      The coated plane problem
 |           |
 |           +-- CPLANET.TXT  - Mesh description file, 1st order triangles
 |           +-- CPLANET.FEM  - The relative mesh file
 |           +-- CPLANE.TXT   - Mesh description file, 2nd order quadrilaterals
 |           +-- CPLANE.FEM   - The relative mesh file
 |           |
 |           |     N.B.  for space reasons only the finer meshes are here 
 |	     |	         included, the reader interested in repeating the
 |           |           complete example needs only to edit the two TXT file 
 |           |           and regenerate the meshes
 |           |
 |           +-- CPLANE.AUX   - Electromagnetic data file, common to both 
 |           |                  cases.
 |           +-- TRIA.RES     - Reflection and Transmission coefficients, 
 |           |                  this is assembled from the various REFLET.DAT
 |           |                  and TRANSMIT.DAT files for different triangular
 |           |                  meshes. It is the file used to generate
 |           |                  the figure in the textbook
 |           +-- QUAD.RES     - Idem, for quadrilateral meshes.
 |           +-- REF.RES      - Idem, but filled with analitycal values.
 |
 +-- WINDOW -+-      The same problem as above, but open at the bottom
 |           |
 |           +-- PLANET.TXT   - Mesh description file, 1st order triangles
 |           +-- PLANET.FEM   - The relative mesh
 |           +-- PLANE##.AUX  - The electromagnetic data file at various 
 |           |                  incidences, 90,70,50,30,10 degrees.
 |           +-- ##R.DAT      - The Reflection coefficients at incidence ##,
 |           |                  it is only file REFLET.DAT with another name.
 |           +-- ##T.DAT      - Idem for Transmission coefficients
 |
 +-- GRATING -+-     Scattering by a strip grating on a dielectric slab   
 |            |      p.e.c. backed
 |            |
 |            +-- GRATING.TXT  - Mesh description file
 |            +-- GRATING.FEM  - The relative mesh
 |            +-- GRATING.AUX  - Electromagnetic data file
 |            +-- S11_000.DAT  - Scattering coefficients of Harmonics
 |            +-- REFLET.DAT   - The reflection coefficient
 |            +-- FIELD000.DAT - The interior field
 |            +-- FIELDGNU.DAT - The same fiels, filtered by the Post-Processor
 |                               and ready to be plotted
 |
 +-- PHOCRY -+-      A photonic crystal example
	     |
	     +-- PHOCRY#.TXT   - Mesh description file for a # layer

	     +-- PHOCRY1.AUX   - The common Electromagnetic datafile,
	     |                   epsilonr = 4
	     +-- PHOCRY2.AUX   - Idem, epsilonr = 8.9
