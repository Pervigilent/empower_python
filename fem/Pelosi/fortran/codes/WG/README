 |       |              N.B. These latter two examples are not described in 
 |       |                   the text for the sake of brevity, but their
 |       |                   utilization is straightforward.

 |                      N.B. Due to the ill conditioning of the problem
 |                           complex mode due to numerical errors may
 |                           arise and very small files .CPL may be created
 |
 +-- COAX -+-   An example spanning a quarter of coaxial cable.
 |         |
 |         +-- COAX.TXT   The mesh description file for the CC
 |         +-- COAX.FEM   The relative mesh

 |          +-- IWG.CPL  The complex modes data
 |          |
 |          +-- N1.DAT   Filtered IWG.OUT, contaning only ordinary modes
 |          |            with ordinary behaviour
 |          +-- N2A.DAT  Filtered IWG.OUT, containing the low frequency part
 |          |            of the dispersion diagram where modes which
 |          |            degenerates still have an ordinary behaviour
 |          +-- N2B.DAT  Idem, for the high frequency part
 |          +-- N3.DAT   Filtered IWG.CPL, containing the complex modes
 |          |            relative to the middle portion of the diagram
 |          +-- GNUBM    A GNUPLOT batch file which masters the previous
 |                       four filtered files, in GNUPLOT type "load 'gnubm'"

	  +-- FIN.AUX    The electromagnetic datafile
	  +-- FIN.OUT    The ordinary modes

			 in the range of interest.
