EMPower Python Application

## Introduction

EMPower Python is a prototype of the EMPower application (under development). After EMPower Python is completed, a C++ implementation will be creted (hopefully). The Python implementation is not fully optimized for performance, or rather, performance is not a primary concern of this implementation.

## EMPower

To run the application, use the following command

```
user@computer:~/empower_python$ python3 -m empower.main
```

### FEM

FEM is intended to be the primary solver for the EMPower application. For now, the documentation from Pelosi et al has been included.

## Mie Scattering

EMPower will eventually have a robust Mie scattering capability. For now, the Mie scattering codes and documentation of Christian Maetzler has been included as a template for developing documentation and algorithms for Mie Scattering.
